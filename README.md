## basic-static-analysis
This repository is a basic static analysis tool that uses Abstract Syntax Trees to parse Python code and identify potential hazards. Currently, it simply notifies the user if any uninitialized variables are discovered. 

### Running the tool
In order to execute analysis.py on example.py, you will need to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Then, just navigate to the project directory and execute the test.sh script.
